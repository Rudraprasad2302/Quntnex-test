## 📌 Project Overview

The Quntnex Test project was built as part of learning and experimenting with:

- Basic programming logic
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Object-Oriented Programming (if used)
- Console-based input/output

It helped me understand how real-world applications are structured and executed.
